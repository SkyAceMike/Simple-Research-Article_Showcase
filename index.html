    <p style="text-align: center;">In Vietnam, kids learn programming in school at age 10. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">In England, that age is 5. </p> 
    <br>
    <p>With a spotlight cast on the Computer Science curriculum worldwide, there's been recent craze around the idea that <b>"Coding is the new literacy."</b></p>
    <p>No matter how many times you hear it, <strong>a job in Computer Science does not guarantee you financial success, or never-ending happiness for that matter.</strong> </p>
    <p>However, there are still some compelling arguments to be made about why everyone should learn to code. </p> 
    <p>So, I will discuss the arguments of both sides to let <span class="tooltip">readers
      <span class="tooltiptext">That's you guys! </span>
    </span> formulate their own opinions. Then, to conclude, I will offer my personal take on why coding just isn't for everyone. Ready? Let's start!</p>

        <p><strong>Proponents</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Skeptics</strong></p>
        <p>but on the other hand, skeptics of widespread code literacy call for more relevant, 
          <span class="tooltip">empirical
            <span class="tooltiptext">"empirical" - Observed in a scientific study </span>
          </span> evidence of the benefits of widespread code literacy. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Skeptics S -->
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>The Skeptics</b></p>
    <p>On one side of the argument, skeptics such as 
      <span class="tooltip">Ronny Scherer
        <span class="tooltiptext">an education researcher at the University of Oslo </span>
      </span> and 
      <span class="tooltip">Peter J. Denning
        <span class="tooltiptext">a computer scientist since the 1960’s who pioneered modern computer memory management </span>
      </span> are calling for the <b>need for more empirical evidence suggesting that proficiency in programming develops proficiency in problem solving.</b></p>
      <p>This "transfer of skill" from programming to problem solving is known as the <b>Transfer Effect</b>, and it's existence is the main contention of debate amongst the scholars.</p>
      <p>Scherer casts doubt on the existence of such transfer effects, stating that the proponents’ <b>“claims have been supplemented with evidence from experimental studies to a very limited extent”</b> and that <b>“most of the empirical research on the transfer effects dates back to the 1980s and 1990s"</b>
        <span class="tooltip">(Scherer, Learning from the Past).
          <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="#cited"><b>Citation 1</b></a> </span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>Tagging along, Denning asserts that <b>“many education researchers have searched for supporting evidence [of computer science transfer effects] but have not found any“</b>
        <span class="tooltip">(Denning).
          <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="#cited"><b>Citation 2</b></a> </span>
        </span></p>

      <p>Skeptics could interpret the current lack of empirical evidence as a sign that learning programming has negligible benefits on everyday problem solving: </p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p><i>If learning to code really does have a significant impact on daily life, there would already exist numerous, conclusive evidence supporting the existence of transfer effects from the 40 year timespan between the 1980’s to 2020.</i></p>
        <p>- A Probable Skeptic</p>
      </div>

      <p>The same skeptics also cite multiple, specific scientific studies that find little to no link between programming and transfer effects.</p>
        
      <p>Once again representing the skeptics, both Scherer and Denning cite <b>Pea and Kurland’s study in 1984</b>, which found <b>"little evidence that learning programming in Logo helped students’ math or general cognitive abilities”</b>
        <span class="tooltip">(Denning).
          <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="#cited"><b>Citation 2</b></a> </span>
        </span>
      </p>

      <p>Most notably, though, is how Denning relates the current craze of code literacy to the old craze of latin literacy. </p>
      <p>He cites a 1997 scholarly article by Koschmann debunking “a new claim that learning programming is good for children just as learning Latin once was. <b>(There was never any evidence that learning Latin helped children improve life skills.)</b>”
        <span class="tooltip">(Denning).

    <!-- Pro S -->
    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>The Proponents</b></p>

    <p>On the other side of the argument, proponents such as 
      <span class="tooltip">Özkan Vatanserver
        <span class="tooltiptext">a teacher at The Ministry of National Education in Turkey</span>
      </span> and  
      <span class="tooltip">Ronny Scherer
        <span class="tooltiptext">again, but this time as a proponent!</span>
      </span> point to their own empirical studies showing <b>statistically significant links between learning coding and transfer skills to problem solving, creative skills, and mathematical skills</b> 
      <span class="tooltip">(Scherer, The Cognitive Benefits of Learning Computer Programming
        <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="#cited"><b>Citation 4</b></a> </span>
      </span>; 
      <span class="tooltip">Vatansever).
        <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="#cited"><b>Citation 3</b></a> </span>
      </span></p>

    <p>Vatanserver's study consists of pre-trial and post-trial, qualitative and quantitative tests done on 5th and 6th graders learning to make games with 
      <span class="tooltip">Scratch
        <span class="tooltiptext"><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"><b>https://scratch.mit.edu/</b></a> </span>
      </span>, a kid-friendly drag-and-drop programming environment.</p>

    <p><b>As expected, this study done in September 2018 found a statistically significant link between learning coding and problem solving skills.</b></p>

    <p><b>Scherer, despite publishing a journal calling the current empirical studies outdated, preformed his own study</b> in which he aggregated as many relevant studies done on the transfer effects of programming as his team could find.</p>

    <p><b>This study, published in July 2019, also found a statistically significant link, supporting the existence of programming transfer effects.</b></p>

    <p>By presenting both individual and aggregate studies, the proponents combat the skeptics’ argument of a lack of empirical evidence.</p>

    <p>Therefore, as a counter-interpretation of the skeptical standpoint mentioned earlier, Proponents could interpret the abundance of empirical evidence as an indication that learning programming — and thus computational thinking — yields significant benefits on everyday problem solving:</p>

    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">

    <p>Generally, the proponents paint a picture of the <b>bright, independent, self-taught, and successful code freelancer in Silicon Valley.</b></p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <p>It's just not worth it. Not unless you have a never-ending passion for coding and everything it entails.</p>
      <p>Not unless you have the need. The need to cut costs for business.</p>
      <p>Not unless you have a dream.</p>
      <p>Somewhere to be, Somewhere to see.</p>
      <p></p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Why Programming?</p>
      <p>What makes it more important, successful, and higher-paying than 
        <br>auto-repair, home maintenance, healthcare?</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Sure, it's nice to try new things</p>
      <p>And you may end up liking it</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>In the end, coding does not guarantee success</p>
      <p>or happiness.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>However, what you choose to do does.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>If coding so happens to be your passion,</p>
      <p>As it is mine,</p>
      <p>You will push yourself until you fall</p>
      <p>And then you will push again.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I won't guarantee that you'll be rich</p>
      <p>or happy.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Because it all depends on what you choose.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>However, I can guarantee that you'll fail, and never get back up.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Not unless you have a dream.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Somewhere to be, Somewhere to see.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>And unless you have a passion,</p>
      <p>Unless programming is your key,</p>
      <p>You've got somewhere else to be.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Somewhere else happier in the heart of your sea.</p>
