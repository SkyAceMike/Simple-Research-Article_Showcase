# Simple Research Article Showcase

Site: https://skyacemike.github.io/Simple-Research-Article_Showcase/

This is a showcase of a very simple article written for an old research project with a focus on being lightweight for static site hosting.

Since this page was only written for a course project pretty long ago, it does not showcase much of my Javascript ability. 
Though, I still think this is a good showcase of the kind of article/blog-like sites I can create.

If I were to recreate this project today, I would use less manual and more scalable tools such as [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) with markdown file tools such as [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter)
